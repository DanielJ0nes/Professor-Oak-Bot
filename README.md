# Professor Oak Bot

Professor Oak is a Discord bot built with Pokémon (and more specifically, Pokémon GO) communities in mind.

From running an active 400+ user Pokémon GO community server myself, I am aware of what features are desirable and have attempted to include them all within Professor Oak.

I am of course always open to new feature suggestions or contributions to the code, hence why this project is almost entirely open source.

Professor Oak primarily uses the Discord.py (a Python wrapper for the Discord API) library.

All Pokémon data is sourced from: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pokemongo-dev-contrib/pokemongo-json-pokedex/master/output/pokemon.json
